                - Lowered time it takes for a product to be searchable in our Image Matching system from 48 hours to less than 12 hours by designing a system that retrieves, normalizes, and handles real-time updates from the Amazon product catalog.<br>
            	- Co-designed a mostly automated data acquisition and ground-truthing system that acquires annotated images from various sources, such as a mobile device, and then automatically validates the images using MTurk.<br>
            	- Increased flexibility of searchable items in our catalog by augmenting our existing Image Matching system to include the concept of "Apps", where each available app contains a different set of images and will be queried in parallel. This augmented system is being used in a very large-scale production setting.<br>
            	- Mentored interns

                - Implemented system to transfer large Lucene indices using BitTorrent from a Master Node to numerous Slave nodes. <br>
                - Integrated BitTorrent into Solr for index replication â€“ this was all done using Java and required an in depth knowledge of the design and architecture of Solr, which I learned very quickly.<br>
                - Compared performance between using Solr built-in index replication and using the BitTorrent component.<br>
                - Documented all work and results and presented project at a Tech Talk.
